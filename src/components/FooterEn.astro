        Risk disclosure: ETF, stocks, futures, foreign currency and options trading contains substantial risk and is not
        for every investor. An investor could potentially lose all or more than the initial investment. Risk capital is
        money that can be lost without jeopardizing one's financial security or lifestyle. Only risk capital should be
        used for trading and only those with sufficient risk capital should consider trading. Past performance is not
        necessarily indicative of future results.

        Disclosure of hypothetical performance: CFTC Rules 4.41 - Hypothetical or Simulated performance results have
        certain limitations, unlike an actual performance record, simulated results do not represent actual trading.
        Also, since the trades have not been executed, the results may have under-or-over compensated for the impact, if
        any, of certain market factors, such as lack of liquidity. Simulated trading programs in general are also
        subject to the fact that they are designed with the benefit of hindsight. No representation is being made that
        any account will or is likely to achieve profit or losses similar to those shown.
