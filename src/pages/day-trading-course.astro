          <div class="accordion-item">
            <a>What makes you different?</a>
            <div class="content">
              <p>
                I started trading the financial markets completely wrong. Because I thought it was easy and anyone could do it with just a few minutes a day. It took me from 2008 to 2021 to become consistent in my trading approach and also with my results. I will give you all my knowledge and show you the pitfalls you should avoid to become a successful trader. 
              </p>
              <p>What's more, 99% of trading coaches do not show their live trading statistics and results. That is why I participated in the Futures World Cup Trading Championship 2021-2022 and made it to the 5th place with a performance of 64.1%.</p>
              <p>And now I'm showing my real trading results with my small account every week on <a class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/@inloopo" target="_blank">my YouTube channel</a>.</p>
              <p>Feel free to check everything out and build confidence.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="accordion-item">
            <a>I have little or no trading experience. Will I struggle?</a>
            <div class="content">
              <p>
                For those who have no trading experience, it will be very intense. Because you have to learn everything from scratch. But this is also a very good opportunity to learn everything right from the beginning and don't get messed up for example by trading the wrong products like CFDs or Knockout Certificates.</p>
                <p>You will learn everything a professional trader should know and how the pig market participants view the stock markets on the intraday timeframe.</p>
                <p>If you have no trading experience at all, but are excited and motivated to learn, I will give you all my support to become successful. But you need to take your time and have a lot of patience and power to internalize everything.</p>

          <div class="accordion-item">
            <a>Do I need to be in front of my screen all day?</a>
            <div class="content">
              <p>
                The name "day trading" does not mean that you have to be in front of the screen all day. As mentioned before, I only trade for 2-3 hours in the evening because it fits perfectly into my life. Other people like to trade earlier in the session, which is also fine. Everyone should find a time in their life that works best for them to trade.</p>

          <div class="accordion-item">
            <a>How long do I need to take the course per day?</a>
            <div class="content">
              <p>
                You can take the course anytime from anywhere in the world. The course is built on a world-leading learning platform that is completely independent of my website. You will have your own private login area with a username and password and will have access to the material 24/7.</p>
                <p>I recommend at least one hour a day for the course and training. The more the better, I guess. There is a lot of information that may be new and everyone should find their own rhythm and pace to absorb it all.</p>

            <a>Will the course get frequently updates?</a>
            <div class="content">
              <p>
                Yes, the course will evolve and grow over time and I will continue to add valuable content at no additional cost.</p>

                For the first 3 months after your purchase, you will have access to my weekly live webinars where I will answer all your questions and we will go through the markets trading setups over and over again. You can also email me your questions. After the first 3 months you can subscribe to my live trading and support webinars for a small monthly fee.</p>

          <div class="accordion-item">
            <a>Which markets do you trade?</a>
            <div class="content">
              <p>
                I mainly trade the most liquid markets such as S&P 500 Index [ES], NASDAQ Index [NQ], Crude Oil [CL] and others.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="accordion-item">
            <a>Do I need to have a big account to start the course?</a>
            <div class="content">
              <p>
                I recommend a minimum account size of at least 5000 USD. Of course the larger the account the better, as you will be more flexible with your trading and risk and money management.</p>
                <p>But you can also start the course without your own trading account and learn everything on simulated demo trading. Once you have internalized everything and are successful with simulated demo trading, you can apply for a funded account at a prop trading firm. With this workaround, your own trading account is not necessary.</p>

          <div class="accordion-item">
            <a>How much money do I have to spent for trading software and live data?</a>
            <div class="content">
              <p>
                To start the course, I recommend using Sierra Charts. Sierra Charts has a 15 days free trial period and after that you will need delayed data to do all the tasks and also to start simulated demo trading.</p>
                <p>To finish the course you will need Package 3 Base Standard for 26 USD per month.</p>
                <p>Once you have finished the simulated demo trading and are ready to trade with real money, you will need to upgrade to e.g. Package 11 for 46 USD per month + Live Data Feed for 34.25 USD per month.</p>
                <p>Please check the current prices on the Sierra Chart Website (https://www.sierrachart.com/index.php?page=doc/Packages.php).</p>

            <a>What timescales or style do you trade with?</a>
            <div class="content">
              <p>
                I usually only trade in the evenings when my kids are asleep because it fits my lifestyle perfectly. In terms of trading, I try to catch the waves that the markets give me. This means I try to find a good entry and stay in the position for a few minutes to an hour.
