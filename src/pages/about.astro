      <h2 class="blog__heading">About me</h2>
      <p>
        I like to function outside of the mainstream. Growing up, my parents laid the foundation for this: at home,
        there was no TV, only vegetarian food and no refined sugar.
      </p>
      <p>
        I moved out when I was 16 because I wanted to become a professional ice speed skater. However, (luckily) it
        didn't work out that way. Later, during my studies, I started checking stock prices. My friends still like to
        make fun of this, but I was just so fascinated by how you could increase your money with the right decisions at
        the right time. My first stock, which my dad gave me at the age of 14, unfortunately went down the drain. But I
        have learnt a lot since then!
      </p>
      <p>
        I was told: earn money first! So I made a brief detour into the automotive industry working as an engineer and
        later as a team leader. It took me 7 years to get out again. Now I live in Cyprus with my wife and my two
        children. I am a trader, investor and entrepreneur. I am living my dream: I spend time with my kids, work
        flexible hours and live where I want to right now.
      </p>
      <p>
        My aim is to help everyone reach their financial goals. The best case scenario is that you can achieve your
        financial freedom too. It is not easy, but everyone can learn how to do it.
      </p>

      <h2 class="article__heading-two">My Mission and Vision</h2>
      <p>
        I want to help people achieve more independence and freedom in their lives. I want my clients to have time for
        the important things in life: their kids, their life goals, their dreams, their friends... I am not in favour of
        using the money to promote consumption, but would like to help people achieve a modest and down-to-earth life
        with vision.

      <p>
        I am here to give you a guide for your investment decisions. Make it easier by using my knowledge for your
        activities in the stock market. If you are as passionate about it as I am, follow me and learn from my
        decisions. With my stock market indicator, I have developed a universal and inexpensive product, which everyone
        can use. Thus, it is possible to beat the market with minimal effort and with a minimal drawdown on capital.
