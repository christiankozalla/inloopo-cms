      <h2>How do I use the economic calendar?</h2>
      <p>
        I use the economic calendar mainly for my day trading. Because there it is very important to know the
        price-moving stock exchange dates. In this economic calendar I deliberately show you only the most important
        economic dates of the US / EU. This way you will not be flooded with unimportant dates and can fully concentrate
        on the most important thing.
